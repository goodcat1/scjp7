Deferred Binding
	Deferred binding is a feature of the GWT compiler that works by generating many versions of code at compile time, only one of which needs to be loaded by a particular client during bootstrapping at runtime. Each version is generated on a per browser basis, along with any other axis that your application defines or uses. For example, if you were to internationalize your application using GWT's Internationalization module, the GWT compiler would generate various versions of your application per browser environment, such as "Firefox in English", "Firefox in French", "Internet Explorer in English", etc... As a result, the deployed JavaScript code is compact and quicker to download than hand coded JavaScript, containing only the code and resources it needs for a particular browser environment.
	
	Deferred Binding Benefits
		Reduces the size of the generated JavaScript code
		Saves development time by automatically generating code
		No run-time penalty to look up an implementation in a data structure as with dynamic binding or using virtual functions.
		
	Deferred Binding using Generators
		Generators are classes that are invoked by the GWT compiler to generate a Java implementation of a class during compilation.
