Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Iterable  A class implementing this interface can be used for iterating with a for each statement.
Collection  Common base interface for classes in the collection hierarchy. When you want to write 
    methods that are very general, you can pass the Collection interface.
    For example, max() method in java.util.Collections takes a Collection and
    returns an object.
