java.util.concurrent.Exchanger

The Exchanger class is meant for exchanging data between two threads. 
What Exchanger does is something very
simple: it waits until both the threads have called the exchange() method. 
When both threads have called the
exchange() method, the Exchanger object actually exchanges the data shared by the 
threads with each other. This
class is useful when two threads need to synchronize 
between them and continuously exchange data.
